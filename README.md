# Do I know you?
Do I know you it's a simple game project. The goal of the game is to have fun with friends and get to know they a little more.

The basic logic of the game is that each individual game has its own unique code. When the player creates a new game it automatically generates a new code for a new room. When a new code is generated a new endpoint is created as well. The other players can join the game with the code, only if the admin accepts them. Each player in the game has to click a button to confirm that they are ready. When all players are ready the game starts.

The game starts picking a random player for the first step.
